# UFOs

## Project Summary

Using Javascript and Bootstrap:

* Use UFO sightings data in the form of data.js file
* Transfer the story to an HTML called index.html
* Write an article within the website
* Display the UFO sightings data as a table
* Use Javascript to apply filters to the table
* Customize the website using Bootstrap

## Recommendation

Filtering by the format of 01/13/2010 does not produce any results but 1/13/2010 produces the results as the data.js file follows the later format.  It is recommended to further develop the code to enable accepting either formats for filtering purposes or embed a calendar to click and select the right date.
